## About

A holiday planner designed for people who hate planning. Initially you create an account, which gains you access to the ability to just quickly generate a full holiday. This is done by simply specifying some details including location and the dates you want to be there. You can also share the trip with friends as well as add landmarks and scheduled events.

## Features

- Simple _TypeForm_ for inputting desired duration, location and ticket type.
- _Skyscanner API_ for getting the cheapest flight details.
- _Google Maps API_ for getting recommended locations at the destination.
  - Recommended locations are based on popularity.
  - Each one is represented at the top of the trip page and can be quickly added.
- Automatic scheduling, locations added to the plan are automatically allocated and can be dragged around and re-ordered.
- _Collaboration_ features; depending on the number of tickets booked other people can be invited to join the trip. They are able to add and organise locations to visit.
