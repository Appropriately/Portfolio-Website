## About

**Almost Pong** was a game I worked on after completing [Little Lander](/2016/11/15/little-lander.html). Like the aforementioned game, it too was based on an older title. The idea was simple, the bottom half would always play like regular pong while the top would change to different *levels*. Initially it too would play like pong, but each level would have different *win* conditions.

The game was never released on the app store, although it was basically feature complete by the time I dropped it. The plan was for the game to be free but with advertisements. Player retention was taken into account, with the user being served advertisements at a rate based on how long their play session took. For example, a player who loses after the second level would not be served an advert whereas a player who had completed 20 has *some* chance of seeing one.
