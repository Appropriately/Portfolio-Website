## About

Built as my **third year project** for University, heavy focus on the concept of _accessability_. This was from both a design and device perspective.

Unity was chosen for the game engine as it allowed cross-compilation. The final version was released as a `WebGL` & `Android` game but was tested as a `windows.exe` file too.

More information and a playable `WebGL` version can be found on the [project's site](https://github.com/Appropriately/programming-tool).
