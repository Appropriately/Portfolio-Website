## Me

* Based in Manchester, United Kingdom.
* Working towards my Computer Science degree at **The University of Manchester**.
* Currently a Developer for **Novacoast, inc**.
  * Worked on a variety of different projects: Linux hardware, Android SDKs and web dev to name a few.
  * The role is very customer facing. I tend to organise client calls and product demonstrations.

## This site

Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), because I needed a decent enough excuse to work with it.

I used [Camille Diez](http://diezcami.github.io)'s [Polar Bear](https://github.com/diezcami/polar-bear-theme) theme but modified it because I wanted it in dark mode. I also wanted to have a good opportunity to mess with *Sass* and Jekyll themeing.
